# Build Something Episode 1 - Parallax Scrolling
This episode demonstrates using canvas to create an image that moves as the user scrolls by it.

## What is Parallax Scrolling?
The earliest examples of parallax scrolling that I personally ever took notice of were in old side scrolling games.  In games like the original Sonic the Hedgehog, the background and foreground move at different speeds relative to each other, in order to give a feel of the distance between them.  Look out the side window towards the horizon next time you're in a car and you'll probably notice a similar effect.

Nowadays parallax scrolling is a bit of a trend on sites looking to add a some dynamic feel to their user experience.  As the user scrolls down, some image or other part of the site moves at a different rate than everything else.  Sites like the home page of [Venus Patrol](http://venuspatrol.com/) and many articles on [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com) make use of this.
